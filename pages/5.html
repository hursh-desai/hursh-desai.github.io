                    <p>I wanted a one stop shop for someone that wanted to get to know who I was. But, I also wanted a place where
                        I could put into practice certain web development concepts such as SEO, SEM, Feature A/B Testing, and novel 
                        web design concepts such as my blog.

                    </header>
                    <p>The website's design does come from a template I found online however, in order to customize it for my needs
                        I did have to delve quite deep into the css and javascript.

                    <p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization and SEM stands for Search Engine Marketing. I first decided to try
                        my hand at SEO to see how well I could do for free. I had to create a sitemap.xml that quite literally was a 
                        map of the pages on this website. After submitting my sitemap to Google Search Console I had to make sure that all
                        my pages had good meta tags so that Google's web crawlers could optimally rank my pages. In the end I would say I did 
                        a pretty good job considering that if you search my full name my portfolio comes up in the top 5 links and a good description)
                        SEM on the other hand is a project that I have dabbled a little bit into however, I am leaving it for a time when I actually
                        have something I deem worthy of advertising.

                        I was reading a medium article from Netflix's

                        <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/decision-making-at-netflix-33065fa06481#:~:text=Instead%20of%20small%20groups%20of%20executives%20or%20experts%20contributing%20to%20a%20decision%2C%20experimentation%20gives%20all%20our%20members%20the%20opportunity%20to%20vote%2C%20with%20their%20actions%2C%20on%20how%20to%20continue%20to%20evolve%20their%20joyful%20Netflix%20experience."
                        target="_blank"
                            style="text-decoration: none;">
                            TechBlog

                    </font>
                    that absolutely inspired my interest into A/B testing. The way it portrayed A/B testing as a democratic means of making
                    product decisions resonated with me quite deeply. And, so I went exploring A/B testing and how I could implement it in my 
                    own way. That is how I found my way to Google Optimize. Since I was already using Google Analytics and had the gtag.js script 
                    on my page supplementing it with a Google Optimize one made the most sense, on top of the fact that Google Optimize is also probably 
                    the easiest way to get A/B testing up and running.

                    <p>My blog is a little project I am quite proud of. I knew that at some point I want to 
                        communicate my ideas/knowledge I have learned over the years in some sort of compilation. However, I know
                        that a tradition blog would've been too restrictive in its format; I like my notes to be on a blank page and
                        handwritten so that I can organize concepts both visually and spacially. The last impetus for this project was 
                        that our thoughts are not permanent. They are ever changing and so a workflow needs to be in place that makes it
                        as seamless to go from idea to publication.
