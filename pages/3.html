                    <p>I was interested in seeing the relationship between
                        Canadian federal elections results and demographic, immigration, and household financial
                        expenditure within Canada.</p>

                    <p>My hypothesis I was testing is that an increase in votes for the Liberal party would have a
                        signficant influence on demographic growth and immigration. While an increase in votes for the
                        Conservative party would increase household financial expenditure based on the power of the
                        party within the country.</p>
                    <p>In order to see that, I first analyzed the data on it's own, before regressing against party
                        voting to see if there were any trends within the country to begin wtih. Then, in order to test
                        our hypothesis, I ran regressions against the three biggest parties within Canada that have been
                        present since 1997 (the start of the Canadian federal election data) and our three data points
                        to see any correlations.</p>
