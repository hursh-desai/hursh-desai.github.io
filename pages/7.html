								<h3>Machine Learning Course</h3>

										projects

								</font> 
								I had to build in order to learn certain important concepts.
								
								I implemented simple ML models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Linear Regression in Numpy. 
								Then I utilized PyTorch to build the more complicated Deep Learning models such as CNN's, RNN's, as well as simple
								perceptron algorithms. We also learned how to appropriately optimize these models to get higher training, validation, and 
								test accuracy.
							</p> 
							<p>Used the classic CIFAR-10 dataset to classify images into 10 different classes. Implemented a Recurrent Neural Network to produce new dinosaur names given a list of already
								existing dinoasur names.</p>

								<h3>Regression and Multivariate Data Analysis</h3>
							</header>
							In my Regression and Multivariate Data Analysis class I created 5 datasets of different data types and
						then used appropriate regression models to interpret underlying trends in the respective data sets. The class was also heavily focused
						on how to interpret the regression diagnostics that tell you whether the assumptions we make in order to use regression are being met or not.

								<h3>Profit Optimization Under Uncertainty</h3>
							</header>
							<p> I took a Decision Models and Analytics class where I built <font color="#92c4eb">
								<a href="https://github.com/hursh-desai/Machine-Learning-Class-Projects">
									models
								</a>
							</font> in Excel to solve important
							optimization and simulation business problems.
	
							Used Simplex Solver to solve linear programming optimization models & GRG Nonlinear or
							Evolutionary Solver to solve non-linear optimization models.
	
							Introduced Crystal Ball for simulation modeling. Simulation models for normal, log-normal,
							bernoulli etc. distributions. Included constraints and optimization for certain variables, i.e.
							simulating profit distribution while minimizing costs under demand uncertainty.
							
							<p>In this project I used Crystal Ball to simulate the profit distribution of a particular
								airline flight while minimizing costs. I had to use simulation modeling because demand
								was uncertain. I used a uniform distribution and a given mean and st. dev. to model the
								demand; and I used a binomial distribution to model how many passangers who bought a
								ticket actually showed up. This airline could overbook for both coach and business class
								so I had to optimize the profit distribution through the # of tickets sold given that
								there was a cost for bumping a passanger.</p>

								<h3>Projects in Programming</h3>
							</header>
							<p>My Projects in Programming class taught me useful skills or tools to work with APIs and the data that we can extract from them through weekly labs.
					This project based class culminated in fully functioning web app as our final project using all the skills we learned throughout the semester.
