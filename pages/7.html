						<h2>Summary</h2>
					</header>
					<p>When I couldn't find classes to teach me skills I was interested in learning I chose a project to
						undertake that would teach me the those skills.</p>
					<p>I wanted to know what fully developing a mobile app from top to bottom required and so I decided
						to build a mobile app in Flutter. I used Google Firestore a NoSQL Database as my backend
						database and made RESTful API calls to pull and update data. I also fully designed the UI and UX
						for the app in Flutter by myself</p>
					<p>Doing a bit of research into the Data Analysis field made me realize that a large part of the
						data collection process is done through API calls. Thus in order to learn more about how they
						were I decided to use the Instagram and Twitter Web API's to build social media audience
						analyzer bots that return actionable information about your audience.</p>
